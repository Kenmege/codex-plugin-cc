# /claude-review:result

## Preflight

1. Prefer the helper binary `codex-claude-review` if it is available on PATH.
2. If it is not available, fall back to:
   `node /Users/kenmege/codex-plugin-cc/scripts/claude-review-companion.mjs`

## Plan

Run the helper in result mode and return the stored output.

## Commands

Use the exact argument tail the user supplied after `/claude-review:result`.

- Preferred:
  `codex-claude-review result <user-arguments>`
- Fallback:
  `node /Users/kenmege/codex-plugin-cc/scripts/claude-review-companion.mjs result <user-arguments>`

## Verification

Do not substitute your own review text for missing helper output.

## Summary

Return the helper stdout verbatim.

## Next Steps

If the user wants a new pass, suggest re-running review or adversarial review.
