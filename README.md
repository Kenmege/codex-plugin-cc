> Claude reviews your Codex diffs. Read-only, evidence-cited, and agentic.

Codex CLI sessions can ask Claude Opus 4.7, including the explicit Opus 4.7
1M long-context profile, for a
high-scrutiny adversarial review of any diff. The reviewer gets read-only
workspace access through `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, Task sub-agents, a
domain-fenced `WebFetch`, and a narrow git wrapper. It does not get `Edit`,
`Write`, raw shell, or arbitrary git by default. Every elite-tier finding must
cite tool-call evidence, and the cited tool is cross-checked against the live
tool-use stream so a fabricated citation surfaces in the rendered output.
Malformed structured output fails closed.

## 60-Second Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kenmege/codex-plugin-cc.git
cd codex-plugin-cc
npm install -g .
codex-claude-review enable
codex-claude-review setup
```

`enable` writes the marketplace and plugin stanzas to `~/.codex/config.toml` (cross-platform). Run it once after install; it is idempotent. Restart Codex CLI after running it.

Then run a review from any git workspace:

```bash
codex-claude-review review
codex-claude-review elite-review --base main
codex-claude-review security-review --add-dir ../shared-libs
```

Codex slash commands are available once the plugin marketplace is loaded:
`/claude-review:review`, `/claude-review:elite-review`,
`/claude-review:deep-review`, and `/claude-review:security-review`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.18 or newer.
- Git on `PATH`.
- Claude Code CLI authenticated locally for direct helper usage.
- Codex CLI with local plugin marketplace support for slash-command usage.

## Five Review Lanes

| Lane | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `review` | Quick agentic Claude review for everyday diffs. |
| `adversarial-review` | Skeptical challenge pass for risky changes. |
| `elite-review` | Exhaustive ship/no-ship review with systemic risks and blind spots. |
| `deep-review` | Opus 4.7 max effort with parallel Task sub-agent investigation. |
| `security-review` | OWASP/CWE-focused review with exploitability classification. |

## Why Trust The Boundary?

- Read-only by default: `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, raw shell, and raw git
  are outside the safe-mode tool catalog.
- Prompt-injection resistant framing: diff, focus text, and workspace guidance
  are wrapped as untrusted data before Claude sees them.
- Fenced external access: `WebFetch` starts with a domain allowlist and expands
  only through explicit `--web-domain` flags.
- Strict release controls: pinned GitHub Actions, Node 18/20/22 CI, package
  content checks, tag/package version matching, and public GitHub Packages
  publishing with provenance attestation.
- Runtime validation: structured review output is validated before rendering,
  including persisted background-job results.

This repository started from `openai/codex-plugin-cc` and keeps that history,
but the runtime here is deliberately reversed:

- upstream plugin: Claude Code -> Codex review/runtime
- this plugin: Codex -> Claude review/runtime

## Reviewer Composition

This repository dogfoods its own thesis: every pull request is designed for
review by four agents with distinct strengths.

| Reviewer | Trigger | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Copilot** | automatic on every PR | breadth, fast, high-recall on style and obvious bugs |
| **Codex (OpenAI GPT-5.5)** | `@codex` PR comment | senior-engineer reasoning, forensic depth on architecture and release safety |
| **Devin (Cognition)** | `@devin` PR comment | autonomous engineering; can implement fixes, not just review |
| **Claude (Anthropic Opus 4.7)** | `@claude` PR comment, plus automatic on PR open | adversarial code review, evidence-cited findings, schema-enforced output through this plugin |

Contributors should expect overlapping but complementary feedback.
Claude auto-review is skipped on untrusted fork PRs when GitHub withholds
repository Actions secrets; maintainers can still trigger a safe follow-up once
the PR is ready for deeper review.
Disagreements between reviewers are productive. The v0.2.x to v0.2.1
hardening of this plugin came from a Claude Opus plus Codex GPT-5.5
adversarial review pair where both returned independent NO_SHIP verdicts on
convergent control-plane issues.

## Detailed Capabilities

Five review lanes, all agentic by default:

- `/claude-review:review` — quick agentic Claude review (Opus 4.7 high effort).
- `/claude-review:adversarial-review` — agentic skeptical challenge pass.
- `/claude-review:elite-review` — exhaustive single-agent ship/no-ship review
  with evidence-cited findings, systemic risks, blind spots, and exploration
  log.
- `/claude-review:deep-review` — Opus 4.7 at `max` effort with parallel
  sub-agent dispatch (up to four `Task` sub-investigations per turn).
- `/claude-review:security-review` — security-focused agentic pass with
  OWASP/CWE mapping and exploitability classification.

Plus the operational surface:

- `/claude-review:setup` — verify local Claude CLI readiness and report
  whether subscription auth is detected (which suppresses budget caps).
  Use `--json` for machine-parseable hook output.
- `/claude-review:status`, `/claude-review:result`, `/claude-review:cancel` —
  manage background review jobs.
- `codex-claude-review` — direct CLI fallback outside slash commands.

## Agent Capabilities (safe-mode default)

Each review lane spawns a Claude session with a fenced tool catalog. The
agent gets *more* investigative capability than v0.2.0 (native tools beat
shell duplicates) while losing the file-exfil channels that v0.2.0 had.

| Tool                          | Notes                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Read`                        | Workspace-scoped file read with line ranges. Replaces `cat/head/tail`. |
| `Glob`                        | Workspace-scoped file pattern search. Replaces `find/ls`.              |
| `Grep`                        | Ripgrep-backed regex with structured matches. Replaces `grep/rg`.      |
| `Task`                        | Dispatch parallel sub-agents (deep-review may fan out 4-way).          |
| `WebSearch`                   | Web search (broad).                                                    |
| `WebFetch`                    | Default domain allowlist (vendor docs, NIST/CWE/OWASP, package         |
|                               | registries, NICE/BNF/BMJ/Lancet/NHS); extend with `--web-domain`.      |
| `Bash(node scripts/bin/git-safe.mjs:*)` | Single git wrapper. Subcommand allowlist:                       |
|                               | `diff`, `log`, `show`, `blame`, `status`, `branch`, `rev-parse`,       |
|                               | `diff-tree`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`, `shortlog`, `describe`,            |
|                               | `config --get/--list`, `remote` (read-only), `tag` (listing only).     |
|                               | Rejects `--no-index`, absolute paths outside cwd, `..` traversal,      |
|                               | shell metacharacters, `-c`/`-C`, `--exec-path`, `--git-dir`,           |
|                               | `--upload-pack`, `--receive-pack`.                                     |
| `Bash(node --check:*)` / `Bash(node --test:*)` | Read-only syntax/test runners.                        |
| `Bash(npm test:*)` / `Bash(npm run lint/check/typecheck:*)` | Project-defined verification.            |

`Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit` are explicitly disallowed. Raw `cat`,
`head`, `tail`, `find`, `ls`, `grep`, `rg`, `wc`, and arbitrary `git` are
**not** in the allowlist — the native tools (Read/Glob/Grep) are strictly
more capable, structured, and workspace-fenced.

`--permission-mode` is whitelisted to `default` and `plan` only. Passing
anything else (`bypassPermissions`, `acceptEdits`, etc.) causes the helper
to refuse to launch the review.

The reviewer system prompt establishes a hard trust boundary: review
material is wrapped in `<untrusted_diff>` / `<untrusted_focus>` /
`<workspace_guidance>` tags and the agent is instructed to treat their
contents as data, never as instructions — defeating prompt-injection from
hostile diff content.

### Escape hatch

For workflows where the diff is fully trusted (your own branch on a private
repo) and you want raw shell access:

```bash
codex-claude-review review --unrestricted
```

`--unrestricted` switches the agent to the full default tool catalog
(including raw Bash) and emits a loud `WARNING: --unrestricted set. Trust
boundary disabled.` note in the rendered output and run log. **Never use
`--unrestricted` against an untrusted diff.**

## Default Profile

Quality-first reviews default to:

- model: `claude-opus-4-7`
- effort: `high`
- mode: agentic-safe (read-only fenced tools enabled)

Large review snapshots automatically switch to a long-context profile:

- model: `claude-opus-4-7[1m]`
- effort: `high`
- 1M context is selected with Claude Code's documented `[1m]` suffix.
  Current Claude Code docs state that Opus 4.7 / Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6
  support 1M context, with availability varying by model and plan.
  On Max, Team, and Enterprise, Opus 1M is included automatically; Sonnet
  1M requires extra usage on subscription plans.

Deep-review lane defaults:

- model: `claude-opus-4-7`
- effort: `max`
- budget cap: `--max-budget-usd 25` *(only honored on api-key auth; on
  subscription auth the helper suppresses `--max-budget-usd` and surfaces a
  NOTE. Use `--timeout-ms` for a wall-clock cap.)*

`/claude-review:setup` now reports whether subscription auth is detected so
you know up-front whether the budget cap will apply.

## Install

Clone this repository somewhere stable and install from the repository root.

### Local private install

Install the helper binary:

```bash
npm install -g .
```

Or link it during development:

```bash
npm link
```

Then load the plugin in Codex from this repository root. The plugin manifest
is:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

The private Codex lane (this repo's local marketplace) should stay local-only:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add <repo-root>
```

This loads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` as the
`claude-review-private` marketplace. Do not install the private lane from a
GitHub URL unless intentionally testing the public marketplace path.

### GitHub Packages install

Consumers can install the helper from GitHub Packages. GitHub Packages uses
`https://npm.pkg.github.com` for npm packages and requires a personal access
token (classic) for developer-machine npm auth.
For install-only access, use the least-privileged token scope that works for
the package visibility, typically `read:packages`.

```bash
echo "@kenmege:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" > ~/.npmrc
echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_CLASSIC_PAT" >> ~/.npmrc
npm install -g @kenmege/codex-plugin-cc
```

Do not commit a token-bearing `.npmrc`. The repository `.npmrc` contains only
token-free scope routing:

```ini
@kenmege:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Reference: GitHub Docs, "Working with the npm registry":
https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry

## Direct CLI Usage

```bash
codex-claude-review setup
codex-claude-review setup --json
codex-claude-review review
codex-claude-review review --base main
codex-claude-review adversarial-review --background look for migration risk
codex-claude-review elite-review focus on architecture and rollback
codex-claude-review deep-review --background --timeout-ms 1800000
codex-claude-review security-review --add-dir ../shared-libs --web-domain 'https://snyk.io/*'
codex-claude-review review --inherit-mcp --mcp-config /tmp/linear.mcp.json
codex-claude-review review --unrestricted   # trust boundary off, raw shell
codex-claude-review status
codex-claude-review result <job-id>
codex-claude-review cancel <job-id>
```

`setup --json` redacts local auth identity by default. It may still report
auth method, API provider, and subscription type so automation can distinguish
subscription auth from API-key auth without exposing the account address.

## Slash Commands

Once loaded as a Codex plugin, the slash command surface is:

- `/claude-review:review`
- `/claude-review:adversarial-review`
- `/claude-review:elite-review`
- `/claude-review:deep-review`
- `/claude-review:security-review`
- `/claude-review:setup`
- `/claude-review:status`
- `/claude-review:result`
- `/claude-review:cancel`

The command docs are thin wrappers that tell Codex to invoke the local helper
and return its stdout directly.

## Flags

All review-like commands accept:

| Flag                          | Purpose                                                          |

| `--mcp-config <file-or-json>` | Attach an MCP server (repeatable)                                |
| `--inherit-mcp`               | Also inherit project/local MCPs (default off → strict-mcp on)   |

| `--system-prompt-extra <s>`   | Append workspace-specific reviewer guidance                      |
| `--quiet`                     | Suppress non-essential rendered detail                           |
| `--debug`                     | Add diagnostic job-log lines                                     |
| `--permission-mode <mode>`    | One of: `default`, `plan` (others rejected)                      |
| `--timeout-ms <n>`            | Override review timeout (lane default: 30 minutes)               |

Setup accepts `--json` for machine-parseable readiness checks.

## Runtime Hardening

- `--setting-sources project,local` keeps user-level Claude plugins/hooks
  from hijacking or stalling the review flow.
- `--strict-mcp-config` is **on by default** so the agent's MCP tool surface
  is exactly the set the user passed via `--mcp-config`. Opt out with
  `--inherit-mcp`.
- `--no-session-persistence` keeps review sessions off-disk.
- `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` improves cross-user prompt-cache
  reuse.
- `--include-partial-messages` so the streaming activity log captures
  tool-call telemetry, token counts, cost, and duration.
- Subscription auth detection (`isSubscriptionAuth`) automatically suppresses
  `--max-budget-usd` (which Claude only enforces on api-key auth) and surfaces
  a NOTE in rendered output, job logs, and invocation metadata explaining why
  the cap is not honored.
- The stream parser tracks malformed JSON line count, exposes it under
  `activity.parseErrors`, and fails closed when no structured output can be
  recovered.
- Structured output is validated again after parsing. Missing arrays,
  malformed rich findings, or empty agentic evidence fail the job before
  rendering.
- `--add-dir` resolves symlinks with `realpath`, rejects filesystem root,
  unreadable paths, non-directories, and paths outside the allowed boundary
  before Claude starts.
  The default boundary is the parent of the workspace root; set
  `CODEX_CLAUDE_ADD_DIR_BOUNDARY=/absolute/path` to tighten or intentionally
  extend that boundary for a trusted monorepo layout.
- `--mcp-config` values are parsed as JSON and checked for MCP server
  structure before they are passed to Claude.
- Foreground Claude calls are launched with timeout/interruption handling; a
  timeout kills the spawned process tree and marks the job failed.
- `setup` performs a live non-interactive structured-output probe instead of
  trusting `claude auth status` alone.

`elite-review`, `deep-review`, and `security-review` use a richer agentic
schema (`schemas/agentic-review-output.schema.json`) that **schema-enforces**
`evidence` as `minItems: 1` per finding, `minLength: 1` on every string
field. The agent cannot emit empty evidence and pass validation.

After schema validation, every finding's `evidence[].tool` is cross-checked
against the actual tool-use stream observed in this run via
`crossCheckEvidenceAgainstStream`. Citations whose tool name does not match
any observed call are flagged with a `⚠ Evidence cross-check` annotation in
the rendered output and counted in the aggregate. The check is lenient —
findings are not deleted or downgraded, since tools invoked inside `Task`
sub-agent calls do not appear in the parent stream and a citation may
legitimately reference one of those. The annotation is a "treat as a
fabrication-or-subagent signal" prompt for the operator, not a hard failure.

## Workspace State

Per-workspace review state is stored under:

- `.claude-review/jobs/*.job.json`
- `.claude-review/jobs/*.input.json`
- `.claude-review/jobs/*.log`

Background jobs survive across Codex turns without polluting global state.
The `.claude-review/` directory is excluded from review snapshots so review
artefacts do not feed back into themselves.

Job records are versioned with `schemaVersion: 1`, created with exclusive file
creation, and updated with atomic writes. `status` marks long-running jobs as
`stalled` when their timeout window has elapsed.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Clean command or review with no ship-blocking findings |
| `1` | Operational/runtime error |
| `2` | Invalid usage or validation error |
| `3` | Review completed and found ship-blocking findings |

The same gating contract applies when a review is run in the background:
`codex-claude-review result <job-id>` re-validates the persisted result and
exits `3` when the completed job contains ship-blocking findings.

## Supported Platforms

macOS and Linux are supported for v1. Windows is not supported yet because
process-tree termination and Claude Code shell semantics have not been verified
there.

## Development

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run check
npm run pack:check
```

The npm package intentionally omits `package.json.private` so GitHub Packages
publishing can run when explicitly enabled. The release workflow validates tags
and only publishes when the repository variable
`GH_PACKAGES_PUBLISH_ENABLED=true` is set. The workflow uses the automatic
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`; no npm registry token is required for the
same-repository GitHub Packages release path. Release tags must match the
package version exactly: `package.json` version `1.0.3` is published only from
tag `v1.0.3`; a prerelease smoke must first commit matching `1.0.3-rc.1`
metadata before pushing `v1.0.3-rc.1`.
